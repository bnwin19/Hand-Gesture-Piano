6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
A user who wants a fun, simple interative musical app that they can control with a unique interactions
such as gestures.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
I created a open hand and closed hand gesture to play the piano key of Gb, a open hand and pointing
hand gesture for the piano key of G, and a closed hand and pointing finger for the piano key of A.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
The amp is simple with the sole purpose of playing a piano with hand gestures, so I kept the 
instructions to miminum since you only need to press one button to get started. I created
a gesture interaction guide for the user to figure out what gestures play what keys on the piano.
